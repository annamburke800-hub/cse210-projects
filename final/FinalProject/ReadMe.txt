Welcome to the Chore Tracker program!

This program will tell you when you last did a chore, when it next needs to be done, and who did it!

There are six parts of the program:

1. See chores
    Selecting this option will allow you to see the details of any of the four chores.
    If you have done this chore, the program will give you the number of days that have passed since it was done,
    and the number of days you have until it next needs to be done. It will also display the person who completed the chore,
    and in Shopping's case, how much it cost.
2. See people
    This option will show you all the people currently logged in the program, along with how much money they currently have.
3. Do chore
    This option will allow you to select a chore that you have done and do it! The days in See Chores will update after you
    complete the chore. You will also be able to log who did the chore.
4. Give Allowance
    This option will allow parents to give allowance to the children in the program. The program automatically calculates the 
    allowance the child is owed, so you only need to select the child getting the allowance and the parent giving the 
    allowance.
5. Save
    This option will allow you to save your chores and people to a file to be loaded later.
6. Load
    This option will allow you to load an outside file of chores and people.

That's it! Happy chores!
